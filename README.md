The begining
Hey everybody:

Just starting to learn how to code and figure this is the best place to start. I have am hoping to learn a languge or two that can help with my data analytical work that I do, there has to be more out there than excel right? I'm particually interested in learning R and Python, maybe some Ruby on Rails for web stuff, Maybe Bed, Bath, & Beyond, I don't know, I don't know if we'll have enough time.
